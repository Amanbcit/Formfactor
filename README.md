# Signup Form with Night Scene Background

A responsive developer signup form featuring glass-morphism design set against an immersive night sky with a realistic moon and starfield.

## Description

Multi-step signup form collecting account information, technical skills (languages, frameworks, DevOps tools), experience level, and additional details. Features dynamic interactions, conditional field visibility, and comprehensive validation.

## Theme Notes

### Design Intent

Creates a serene, professional atmosphere through a night sky theme that evokes creativity and focus. The translucent form floats elegantly over the cosmic backdrop while maintaining excellent readability and allowing the scenery to remain visible.

### Color Palette

- **Night Sky:** Deep midnight blue (#0a1128) transitioning through indigo to rich purple (#1a0b2e)
- **Moon:** Warm cream to tan gradient (#fffef0 → #d4c5a9) with soft yellow glow
- **Primary Color:** Professional navy blue (#163c6d) for buttons and accents
- **Form Background:** Translucent white (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)) with 12px backdrop blur
- **Text:** Dark grey (#1a1a1a) on light backgrounds for WCAG AA compliance

### Contrast & Accessibility

- High contrast ratios throughout for readability
- 2px focus outlines on all interactive elements
- Numbered fieldset legends guide users through the multi-step process
- Clear visual hierarchy with prominent submit button

### Gradient Usage

**1. Linear Gradient (Night Sky):**
- Direction: Top to bottom (180deg)
- Creates atmospheric depth from deep space to horizon
- Colors: #0a1128 → #1e1b4b → #2d1b69 → #1a0b2e

**2. Radial Gradient (Moon Glow):**
- Position: 80% horizontal, 20% vertical (top-right)
- Creates soft moonlight illumination
- Color: rgba(255, 255, 200, 0.15) fading to transparent

**3. Multiple Radial Gradients (Stars):**
- 50+ individual stars at varying sizes (0.5px - 1.5px)
- Creates dense, realistic starfield with depth
- Distributed across entire viewport

**4. Radial Gradient (Moon Surface):**
- Elliptical gradient from top-left creating natural illumination
- 5 crater gradients using tan/beige tones for realistic texture
- Multi-stop gradient provides dimensional appearance

### Glass-Morphism Effect

- 85% opaque background with 12px backdrop blur
- Layered shadows create depth and separation
- Subtle white border enhances glass rim appearance
- Content remains readable while showing background scene
